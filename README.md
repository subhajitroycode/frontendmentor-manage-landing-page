## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/) - JS library for slider

### What I learned

Before taking on this challenge, I mastered the basics of tailwindcss, a utility-first framework for building responsive websites. I customized the color palette in my tailwind config file to match the design specifications. I also integrated Swiper JS, a powerful and modern library for creating interactive sliders, to showcase the testimonials from satisfied customers. Although one thing you have to write lots of classes and some of them are very repetitive.


### Continued development

I will try to build more projects with tailwindcss in the future and also how to use this with a React project.
